# GDX-graph

A library for [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ "libGDX") cross-platform game development framework.

## Status

GDX-graph is undery heavy development at the moment. The devlogs are available
on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqpawGIg6Qj5CvjOaCbB536z862XhjPQi)

Current version is 0.5.1 - beta release.

## Goal

The goal is to make game development using libGDX much easier for people who are not very experienced with 2d and 3d
graphics. The project's goal is to not only make game development faster, but also much easier, and remove one of the
biggest barriers of entry into game development - the complexity of efficient rendering.

## Documentation

Documentation is available [here on Github](https://github.com/MarcinSc/gdx-graph/wiki).

## Plans

The plan is to cover and abstract out from your game development things like - post-processing effects, efficient and
optimized rendering, as well as advanced particle effects, while allowing for high quality rendering using physically
based rendering or stylized rendering, as well as highly-customizable particle effects.
